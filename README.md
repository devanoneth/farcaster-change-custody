# Farcaster Change Custody

A simple script to help change the custody account of a Farcaster FID.

This script has not been audited, and frankly, barely tested. I used it once, and it worked for me. USE ONLY AT YOUR OWN RISK. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

## Usage

You must have ETH on Optimism on the account currently custodizing the Farcaster FID.

1. Clone this repo.
2. `pnpm i`
3. Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file and fill out the required values.
4. `pnpm start`
5. Done!
